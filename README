# PETSc-3.9.3 works

flame1D_guess.c: This version works for the special initial guess. The initial guess
comes from the solution of system for the fixed rho and mu.

flame1D.c: Pesudo-time + Newton Solver.

flame1D_NE.c: -NE such that we solve steady-state problem using NE solver

flame1D_NE_mod.c: -NE such that we solve steady-state problem using adaptive NE solver
                  rho and eta control whether we choose Newton or NE
